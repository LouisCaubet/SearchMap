# SearchMap

Personal project by Louis Caubet, 2020.

## Objective

When doing online research for large projects, it can be hard to keep track of the findings and share them with a team. SearchMap's goal is to help with that by representing results in a graph that can easily be read, edited and shared. 

## Features

Already implemented features include:
- Adding and editing nodes representing websites, files, titles or texts
- Moving nodes around, reparenting them, adding connections between them.
- Complete editor features for SearchMap (Clipboard, Undo/Redo, etc.)

## Technologies

This project is developed in C# / .NET, using a core library in .NET Core, a Windows software built on Windows Presentation Foundation. There are plans for a cross-platform Xamarin app, and a Chromium web extension.
